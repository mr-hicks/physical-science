This is my website containing resources and plannbook.
It is divided into two general segments, students and educators.
The students should see blog posts indicating what is done on each day with links to any needed info as well as assignments.
The edu page will list the units for which I have taught, then link to the unit lesson plans as well as the reflection pages over how each lesson went.
There should be a 1:1 corrolation with student assignment/resource posts with edu assignment/resource/reflection posts.
The front matter will be the same with the addition of a reflection section.

As I believe in the open source community all of my content is saved on Github and hence I'm using Github Pages.
This allows for all past versions of lesson plans and materials to be available without cluttering up folders.
Allowing for their to be one, and only one, file tree for my teaching materials.

This is the based on the default Jekyll theme minima.
You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
In addition to the Jekyll documentation, I also went through the [Jekyll for Web Designers tutorial](https://github.com/jameswillweb/jekyll-for-designers) [lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com) course.
