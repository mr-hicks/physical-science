# Neutrons
Neutrons are the glue that hold the nucleus together.
They act as 'spacers' to keep the protons just enough seperated that the **nuclear forces** can overcome the **electric forces** that are trying to force the **protons** apart.

## Isotopes
**Protons** determine the element, but **neutrons** determine the **isotope**.
An **isotope** is an element that has the number of **neutrons** specified.
If no number is specified, it is assumed that you are refering to a bunch of atoms, the **element**, if you specify the number of **neutrons** you are refering to an individual atom.

Examples:

  * Carbon is a element.
  * Carbon-12 is an **isotope**.
  * Carbon-13 is an **isotope**.
  * Carbon-14 is an **isotope**

In nature, **isotopes** occur in certain percentages depending upon how stable a given **isotope** is.
