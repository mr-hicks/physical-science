Here is some of the outward facing content that is useful for more selective access, or just not as easy to put on the website for whatever reason.

## Standards
Our school is transitioning to standards referenced grading.
As such we have to write out our proficiency scales, and standards for the year.

Additionally there are:

  * Letter to parents describing the grading
  * Year overview
  * Proficiency for the three standards we are using
    * Core ideas
    * Practices - Lab notebook
    * Practices - Lab reports
