# Mr. Hicks github repository for teaching

Here is maintained all of the teaching resources I have collected and generated as well as a blog hosted on github pages that acts as a plan book and a journal.

The general structure is the webpage is split out into its own github project.
It pulls the readme files out of the units in order to generate the educator section of the website.
Generated materials that are needed for the students are stored in the unit folder (/units/resource) and linked or imported to the blog.
In this fashion from one semester to the next the student materials can be re-ordered as needed.

The readme files of each unit contain the most recent lesson plan of each topic.
To see what they used to look like when taught at a past time, do the following:
    
    Insert a section explaining how to roll back time in github.
