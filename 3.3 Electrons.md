# Electrons
Electrons are the tiny (relative to protons and neutrons), negatively charged, sub-atomic particles that fly around the outside of every atom.

| Mass | Charge | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| $\approx$ 0 u | -1 | Outside |

## Energy Levels
There are two things you need to know about electrons, they don't share their space, and they all want to be as close to the nucleus as possible. So:

  * Electrons exist in different **energy levels** because they cannot share space.
  * Electrons fill from the lowest or closest **energy level** outward because they want to be as close as possible.

One last thing about electrons.
Electrons are directionally challenged, meaning that if one travels left, and one travels right, then they don't interfer with eachother.
This means that 2 electrons can fit into each **energy level**, hence the 2 in the equation below.

Long story short, each orbital n, can hold $$\text{Electrons per obital n} = 2n^2$$
The first orbital can hold 2, the second can hold 8, the third can hold 18, and so on.

The simplest way to show the orbitals or **energy levels** is to have a central nucleus with concentric rings representing the electron orbitals.

This model is good for quick sketching but does not represent the actual locations of electrons, but does show the concept of **energy levels** very well.
In the current model, the **energy levels** are called orbitals because the locations of the electrons is no where near spherical.
Below is the current model, note how the final result is that the elctrons are packed as closely as possible to eachother and the nucleus.

## Valence Electrons
**Valence electrons** are the outermost layer of electrons.
